# Forest-Fire-Prediction-Django-App
This is a Forest fire prediction app using Random Forest Regression

# Introduction
Forest, Bush or Vegetation fire, can be described as any uncontrolled and non-prescribed combustion or burning of plants in a natural setting such 
as a forests, grassland, etc.

In this project we are predicting the confidence of the Forest Fire based on some attributes.

# Model
We are using Random Forest Regression model and train that model using the dataset.

Also, we will see RandomSearchCV in action and how we have implemented it.
